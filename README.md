## Project Description

The goal of this project is to raise awareness ,increase transparency and create a platform that allows people to easily learn about how crime is affecting their community. Also, it is important for the public to be informed about how well the police are protecting their community. In addition, this web application can be used to help people make better informed decisions when deciding where to live.

## Target Audience

My target audience consists of people who are curious about the evolution or spread of crime in Seattle. In addition, this web application can be useful to law enforcements, researchers, politicians, and criminal justice professionals to gain a deeper understanding of crime and society.

By using this web application the audience will learn about patterns and trends over time. The goal is that with more knowledge gained, crime statistics can be used as a tool to decrease future crimes. In addition, predicting where crimes might occur can help criminal justice professionals deploy their limited resources to the community in need. 


## Data

The dataset set includes information from 2008 - 2020 about the crimes committed in Seattle. In addition, this dataset includes information, such as the type of crime committed and its corresponding neighborhood, precinct, date occurred and date reported. This dataset was compiled by the Seattle Police Department by utilizing data from the National Incident-Based Reporting System(NIBRS).
